# Klein-Neumann-ConverIt
Group Project - Spring 2017 

The bulk of the website is pages that have conversions with different measurement types. They include temperature, weight and time. We  also included currency conversions which pull the data from the ExchangeRate API (https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). We did it using an API because the currency exchange rates are constantly changing.
